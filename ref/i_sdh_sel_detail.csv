This 7602 Number of Children includes a calculated mode of Number of Children from the ZIP9 and ZIP which brings the coverage up to 100%.  The basis of this element is 9602 Number of Children PLUS.  Calculating the mode of the ZIP9 and ZIP can add data to all Number of Children values.
NOTE: For the HOUSEHOLD LEVEL children's data: The children's names are not provided by the sources.  The logic gathers the children's ages from across all the sources into a table to net the data to only the children's ages that exist in a household.  Proprietary logic calculates the netting.  The resulting ages are then populated into the children's age elements, then counted to populate the number of children element and the presence of children element.
